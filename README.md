**B.Tech. Information Technology Advanced Technology Lab Project**  

The Sports and fitness industry domain has been an integral part of mobile applications since the invention of smart phones. Various apps in this domain have helped users maintain a healthy lifestyle through regular exercise guidance, yoga, sports training, and many more. This domain has attracted very large audiences and has enabled users to pursue their physical activity interests, all while staying fit and healthy.  

The ‘Spielen’ **Android application** caters towards users looking to play sports, and not let the absence of people to play with be an obstacle to their passion.
